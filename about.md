I am an incoming master student at the [Department of Computer Science](http://web.cs.toronto.edu).
I will be joining the [EcoSystem](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/ecosystem/) under the
supervision of [Professor Gennady Pekhimenko](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pekhimenko/).

My work revolves around compilers. Hopefully, they are better at generating code
than monkeys typing on keyboards.
